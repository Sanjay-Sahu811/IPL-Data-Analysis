  <h2>IPL Data Analysis In Databricks</h2>
</p>

Use the IPL dataset in this repo, upload it to any cloud storage like Azure/AWS/GCP and read it from there into Databricks.
Else upload the files into databricks and start analysing the data.

I have wriiten the solution in PySpark.

Below are the questions that I created and tried to find the answers.

- Find out max and min wicket taken by a bowler in each season ?
- Find out bowler taken wicket of same player more than once in same season or diff season?
- Find out which bowler has given max and min runs in a season?
- Find out which bowler has taken max wicket against each team?
- Find out which team went into finals most of the times?
- Find out how many times teams have won IPL?
- Find out the if a team wins a toss and choose to bat do they win the match also?
- Find out city/venue where max and min matches where played in each season?
- Find the strongest and weakest teams based on match wins?
- Find matches per season and plot them as a bar chart?
- Visualize most final matches played by a team?
- Who won most man of the matches?
